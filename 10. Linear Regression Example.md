# Exercise: Simple Linear Regression and Flask API  
   
In this exercise, we will perform simple linear regression using Python and expose the linear function as an API using Flask. We will use a sample dataset to train a linear regression model and then create an API endpoint to make predictions based on the trained model.  
   
## Prerequisites  
   
Before we begin, you need to install Python and the necessary packages on your local machine.  
   
### Installing Python  
   
1. **Windows**:  
   - Download the Python installer from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/  
   - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".  
   
2. **macOS**:  
   - Download the Python installer from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/  
   - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.  
   
3. **Linux**:  
   - Open Terminal.  
   - Install Python using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, run:  
     ```sh  
     sudo apt-get install python3  
     ```  
   
### Installing Necessary Packages  
   
1. Open Terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows).  
2. Install the necessary packages using `pip` by running the following command:  
   ```sh  
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn flask  
   ```  
   
## Step 1: Perform Simple Linear Regression  
   
1. Create a new Python file named `linear_regression.py`.  
2. Add the following code to perform simple linear regression on a sample dataset:  
   
```python  
import numpy as np  
import pandas as pd  
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression  
import pickle  
   
# Sample dataset  
data = {  
    'X': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],  
    'Y': [2, 4, 5, 4, 5]  
}  
   
# Create a DataFrame  
df = pd.DataFrame(data)  
   
# Split the data into training and testing sets  
X = df[['X']]  
y = df['Y']  
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)  
   
# Train the linear regression model  
model = LinearRegression()  
model.fit(X_train, y_train)  
   
# Save the trained model to a file  
with open('linear_model.pkl', 'wb') as f:  
    pickle.dump(model, f)  
   
print("Model trained and saved as 'linear_model.pkl'")  
```  
   
3. Run the `linear_regression.py` script to train the model and save it to a file:  
   ```sh  
   python linear_regression.py  
   ```  
   
## Step 2: Create a Flask API  
   
1. Create a new Python file named `app.py`.  
2. Add the following code to create a Flask API that exposes the linear regression model:  
   
```python  
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify  
import pickle  
import numpy as np  
   
app = Flask(__name__)  
   
# Load the trained model  
with open('linear_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:  
    model = pickle.load(f)  
   
@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])  
def predict():  
    data = request.get_json()  
    X_new = np.array(data['X']).reshape(-1, 1)  
    prediction = model.predict(X_new)  
    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction.tolist()})  
   
if __name__ == '__main__':  
    app.run(debug=True)  
```  
   
3. Run the Flask app:  
   ```sh  
   python app.py  
   ```  
   
4. The Flask app will start running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.  
   
## Step 3: Test the API  
   
1. Open a new Terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows).  
2. Use `curl` to send a POST request to the API with sample data:  
   ```sh  
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"X": [6, 7, 8]}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict  
   ```  
   
3. You should receive a JSON response with the predictions based on the linear regression model.  
   
Congratulations! You have successfully performed simple linear regression and exposed the linear function as an API using Flask. Keep practicing and exploring different scenarios to enhance your machine learning and web development skills.
