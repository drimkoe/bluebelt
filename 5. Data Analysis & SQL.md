Let's get started with some exercises!  
   
## Exercise 1: Retrieving Data  
   
Write an SQL query to retrieve the first and last names of all people in the dataset.  
   
**Query:**  
```sql  
SELECT first_name, last_name  
FROM people;  
```  
   
**Purpose:**  
This exercise helps you understand the basic syntax of a SELECT statement and how to retrieve specific columns from a table.  
   
## Exercise 2: Filtering Data  
   
Write an SQL query to retrieve the first and last names of people who reside in California.  
   
**Query:**  
```sql  
SELECT p.first_name, p.last_name  
FROM people p  
JOIN states s ON p.state_abbrev = s.state_abbrev  
WHERE s.state_name = 'California';  
```  
   
**Purpose:**  
This exercise introduces the JOIN operation to combine information from the `people` and `states` tables. You will learn how to filter rows based on a specific state name.  
   
## Exercise 3: Sorting Data  
   
Write an SQL query to retrieve the first and last names of people in descending order of their competition points.  
   
**Query:**  
```sql  
SELECT first_name, last_name  
FROM people  
ORDER BY comp_points DESC;  
```  
   
**Purpose:**  
This exercise teaches you how to use the ORDER BY clause to sort the results in ascending or descending order. You will learn how to sort data based on the `comp_points` column.  
   
## Exercise 4: Aggregating Data  
   
Write an SQL query to calculate the total number of people who prefer shirts.  
   
**Query:**  
```sql  
SELECT COUNT(*) AS shirt_count  
FROM people  
WHERE shirt_or_hat = 'shirt';  
```  
   
**Purpose:**  
This exercise introduces the COUNT function, which allows you to count the number of rows that match a specific condition. You will learn how to count the total number of people who prefer shirts.  
   
## Exercise 5: Joining Tables  
   
Write an SQL query to retrieve the first and last names of people who are affiliated with the company "Schmidt, Gonzalez and Schroeder" and belong to the "blue" team.  
   
**Query:**  
```sql  
SELECT p.first_name, p.last_name  
FROM people p  
JOIN states s ON p.state_abbrev = s.state_abbrev  
WHERE p.company = 'Schmidt, Gonzalez and Schroeder'  
  AND p.team = 'blue';  
```  
   
**Purpose:**  
This exercise demonstrates how to perform a JOIN operation to combine information from multiple tables. You will learn how to join the `people` and `states` tables and retrieve data based on specific criteria.  
   
## Exercise 6: Grouping and Aggregating Data  
   
Write an SQL query to calculate the average competition points for each team.  
   
**Query:**  
```sql  
SELECT team, AVG(comp_points) AS average_points  
FROM people  
GROUP BY team;  
```  
   
**Purpose:**  
This exercise introduces the GROUP BY clause, allowing you to group rows based on a specific column. You will learn how to calculate the average competition points for each team using the AVG function.  
   
## Exercise 7: Date Manipulation  
   
Write an SQL query to retrieve the first and last names of people who signed up in the year 2016.  
   
**Query:**  
```sql  
SELECT first_name, last_name  
FROM people  
WHERE strftime('%Y', signup) = '2016';  
```  
   
**Purpose:**  
This exercise demonstrates how to extract specific parts (year, in this case) from a date column. You will learn how to filter data based on the signup year.  
   
## Exercise 8: Subqueries  
   
Write an SQL query to retrieve the first and last names of people who belong to the team with the highest average competition points.  
   
**Query:**  
```sql  
SELECT first_name, last_name  
FROM people  
WHERE team = (  
  SELECT team  
  FROM (  
    SELECT team, AVG(comp_points) AS average_points  
    FROM people  
    GROUP BY team  
    ORDER BY average_points DESC  
    LIMIT 1  
  ) AS subquery  
);  
```  
   
**Purpose:**  
This exercise introduces subqueries, which are queries nested inside another query. You will learn how to retrieve data based on the result of a subquery, in this case, finding the team with the highest average competition points and selecting people from that team.  
   
## Exercise 9: Filtering with Multiple Conditions  
   
Write an SQL query to retrieve the first and last names of people who belong to the "red" or "green" team and have more than 50 competition points.  
   
**Query:**  
```sql  
SELECT first_name, last_name  
FROM people  
WHERE team IN ('red', 'green')  
  AND comp_points > 50;  
```  
   
**Purpose:**  
This exercise teaches you how to filter data based on multiple conditions using the IN operator. You will learn how to select people who belong to specific teams and have a competition score greater than 50.  
   
## Exercise 10: Pattern Matching  
   
Write an SQL query to retrieve the first and last names of people whose last names start with the letter "S".  
   
**Query:**  
```sql  
SELECT first_name, last_name  
FROM people  
WHERE last_name LIKE 'S%';  
```  
   
**Purpose:**  
This exercise demonstrates the use of the LIKE operator for pattern matching. You will learn how to retrieve data based on a specific pattern, in this case, finding people with last names starting with "S".  
   
## Exercise 11: Null Values  
   
Write an SQL query to retrieve the first and last names of people who have not provided their company affiliation.  
   
**Query:**  
```sql  
SELECT first_name, last_name  
FROM people  
WHERE company IS NULL;  
```  
   
**Purpose:**  
This exercise introduces the concept of handling null values. You will learn how to select people who have not provided a value for the `company` column.  
   
## Exercise 12: Limiting Results  
   
Write an SQL query to retrieve the first and last names of the top 5 people with the highest competition points.  
   
**Query:**  
```sql  
SELECT first_name, last_name  
FROM people  
ORDER BY comp_points DESC  
LIMIT 5;  
```  
   
**Purpose:**  
This exercise teaches you how to limit the number of rows returned using the LIMIT clause. You will learn how to retrieve only the top 5 people with the highest competition points.
