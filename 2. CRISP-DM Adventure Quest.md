## Storyline:

Once upon a time, in a world of data and discovery, Professor Datawise reached out to your team with a mysterious request for help. Professor Datawise, an esteemed data scientist at Cisco, was conducting vital research on network security.

The message from Professor Datawise read, "Dear Data Explorers, I am in desperate need of your expertise. My network security data has become a tangled mess, and I need your assistance to untangle it. Meet me at the Enchanted Forest, where the secrets of CRISP-DM await."

Excited and intrigued, you and your team embarked on a journey to the Enchanted Forest. As you entered the forest, you came across a signpost with six paths, each labeled with a stage of CRISP-DM.

## Stages, Scenarios, Decision Points, and Challenges:

**Stage 1: Business Understanding**

Scenario: Professor Datawise wants to improve network security by analyzing network traffic patterns.

Challenge: Identify the key questions to ask Professor Datawise to gain a clear understanding of his objectives and the stakeholders' needs.

Decision Point: Which questions will you ask to gather the necessary information for the project? 

**Stage 2: Data Understanding**

Scenario: You discover a hidden vault containing a large dataset of network traffic logs from Cisco's global network infrastructure.

Challenge: Solve a puzzle or riddle related to data understanding to unlock the vault and access the valuable network traffic data.

Puzzle:
I am a sequence of numbers that represent network traffic data. The numbers indicate the number of packets captured during specific time intervals. Decode the sequence and find the missing number to complete the pattern.

Sequence: 3, 5, 8, _, 13, 21

Hint: Look for a pattern in the differences between consecutive numbers.


Decision Point: Choose the correct solution to the puzzle or riddle based on your understanding of the given network traffic data and its characteristics.

**Stage 3: Data Preparation**

Scenario: To prepare the network traffic data for analysis, you need to handle missing values, clean the dataset, and transform the data into a suitable format for modeling.

Challenge: You encounter various data preparation obstacles that need to be addressed.

Decision Point: Determine the most effective data preparation techniques and tools to overcome these obstacles and prepare the network traffic data for modeling.

**Stage 4: Modeling**

Scenario: You have prepared the network traffic data and are ready to build a predictive model to detect potential security threats.

Challenge: Select the most suitable algorithm and modeling techniques for anomaly detection.

Decision Point: Choose the algorithm and techniques that best fit the problem at hand, considering factors such as anomaly detection capabilities, computational efficiency, and scalability.

**Stage 5: Evaluation**

Scenario: After building the predictive model for network security threat detection, you need to evaluate its performance and assess its accuracy in identifying anomalies and potential threats accurately.

Challenge: Design an evaluation process to assess the model's performance.

Decision Point: Determine the appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques to measure the model's performance, such as precision, recall, and F1 score, to ensure reliable threat detection.

**Stage 6: Deployment**

Scenario: Cisco wants a user-friendly solution to access and utilize the network security threat detection model in real-time to protect their network infrastructure.

Challenge: Determine the most appropriate deployment method for real-time threat detection and mitigation.

Decision Point: Choose the deployment method that ensures seamless integration with Cisco's network infrastructure, considering factors such as network monitoring tools, APIs, and scalability.

## Recording:
- Use pen and paper or a shared document to record your team's decisions and chosen solutions.
- Ensure each team member has a chance to contribute and discuss the decisions.

## Solutions:
- After each challenge, the provided solutions will be shared for comparison.
- Reflect on your team's decisions and discuss the outcomes and the reasoning behind your choices.

## Enjoyment:
- Embrace the storytelling and immerse yourselves in the adventure.
- Engage in teamwork, communication, and critical thinking.

Have fun and embark on an exciting journey through the CRISP-DM Adventure Quest!
