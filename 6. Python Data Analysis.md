# Python Data Analysis Exercises

In this notebook, we will explore a dataset containing information about people, including their names, cities, states, company affiliations, and more. We will use Python and its data analysis libraries to extract useful insights from the data and visualize them using the seaborn library.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following tables:

### `states` table

- `state_name`: The name of the state.
- `state_abbrev`: The abbreviation of the state.
- `region`: The region where the state belongs.
- `division`: The division where the state belongs.

### `people` table

- `first_name`: The first name of the person.
- `last_name`: The last name of the person.
- `city`: The city where the person resides.
- `state_abbrev`: The abbreviation of the state where the person resides.
- `shirt_or_hat`: Indicates whether the person prefers a shirt or a hat.
- `comp_points`: The number of competition points the person has earned.
- `team`: The team the person is associated with.
- `signup`: The date when the person signed up.
- `id_number`: The identification number of the person.
- `company`: The company the person is affiliated with.

## Getting Started

To get started, you need to upload the dataset file to your Google Colab environment.

1. Go to the Files section on the left sidebar of your Google Colab environment.
2. Click on the "Upload to session storage" button.
3. Select the dataset file from your local machine and click "Open" to upload it.

Once the dataset is uploaded, we can proceed with the exercises.

## Exercise 1: Reading Data

Write Python code to read the data from the `people` table and store it in a DataFrame.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming the data is in a CSV file named 'people.csv'
people_df = pd.read_csv('people.csv')
```

## Exercise 2: Filtering Data

Write Python code to filter the DataFrame and retrieve the first and last names of people who reside in California.

```python
california_people = people_df[people_df['state_abbrev'] == 'CA']
california_names = california_people[['first_name', 'last_name']]
```

## Exercise 3: Sorting Data

Write Python code to sort the DataFrame in descending order of competition points and retrieve the first and last names of people.

```python
sorted_people = people_df.sort_values(by='comp_points', ascending=False)
sorted_names = sorted_people[['first_name', 'last_name']]
print(sorted_names)
```

## Exercise 4: Aggregating Data

Write Python code to calculate the total number of people who prefer shirts.

```python
shirt_count = (people_df['shirt_or_hat'] == 'shirt').sum()
print(shirt_count)
```

## Exercise 5: Joining DataFrames

Write Python code to join the `people` and `states` DataFrames based on the state abbreviation and retrieve the first and last names of people who reside in California.

```python
states_df = pd.read_csv('states.csv')
merged_df = pd.merge(people_df, states_df, on='state_abbrev')
california_people = merged_df[merged_df['state_name'] == 'California']
california_names = california_people[['first_name', 'last_name']]
```

## Exercise 6: Grouping and Aggregating Data

Write Python code to calculate the average competition points for each team.

```python
average_points = people_df.groupby('team')['comp_points'].mean()
print(average_points)
```

## Exercise 7: Date Manipulation

Write Python code to retrieve the first and last names of people who signed up in the year 2016.

```python
people_df['signup'] = pd.to_datetime(people_df['signup'])
signed_up_2016 = people_df[people_df['signup'].dt.year == 2016]
names_2016 = signed_up_2016[['first_name', 'last_name']]
print(names_2016)
```

## Exercise 8: Filtering with Multiple Conditions

Write Python code to retrieve the first and last names of people who belong to the "red" or "green" team and have more than 50 competition points.

```python
filtered_people = people_df[(people_df['team'].isin(['red', 'green'])) & (people_df['comp_points'] > 50)]
filtered_names = filtered_people[['first_name', 'last_name']]
```

## Exercise 9: Pattern Matching

Write Python code to retrieve the first and last names of people whose last names start with the letter "S".

```python
matching_names = people_df[people_df['last_name'].str.startswith('S')]
matching_names = matching_names[['first_name', 'last_name']]
```

## Exercise 10: Handling Missing Values

Write Python code to retrieve the first and last names of people who have not provided their company affiliation.

```python
missing_company = people_df[people_df['company'].isnull()]
missing_names = missing_company[['first_name', 'last_name']]
```

## Exercise 11: Limiting Results

Write Python code to retrieve the first and last names of the top 5 people with the highest competition points.

```python
top_5_people = people_df.nlargest(5, 'comp_points')
top_5_names = top_5_people[['first_name', 'last

_name']]
```

## Exercise 12: Visualizing Data with Seaborn

Now, let's practice visualizing the data using the seaborn library.

1. Import the seaborn library.

```python
import seaborn as sns
```

2. Create a bar plot to show the count of people in each team.

```python
sns.countplot(data=people_df, x='team')
```

3. Create a scatter plot to show the relationship between competition points and signup date.

```python
sns.scatterplot(data=people_df, x='signup', y='comp_points')
```

4. Create a box plot to compare the distribution of competition points for each team.

```python
sns.boxplot(data=people_df, x='team', y='comp_points')
```

5. Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of competition points.

```python
sns.histplot(data=people_df, x='comp_points', bins=10)
```

6. Create a violin plot to compare the distribution of competition points for each team.

```python
sns.violinplot(data=people_df, x='team', y='comp_points')
```

7. Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between numerical columns in the DataFrame.

```python
numeric_columns = ['comp_points', 'id_number']
sns.heatmap(data=people_df[numeric_columns].corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
```

Congratulations on completing the exercises! You've gained experience in analyzing and manipulating data using Python and pandas, as well as visualizing data using seaborn. Keep practicing and exploring different scenarios to enhance your data analysis and visualization skills.

Happy coding!
